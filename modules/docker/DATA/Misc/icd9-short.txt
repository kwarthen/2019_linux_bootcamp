ICD-9 Codes for Family Medicine 2011-2012: The FPM Short List"Note: Codes that include NOS (not otherwise specified) or unspec. (unspecified) have alternative diagnosis codes that are more specific. These alternatives can be found in or near the section of ICD-9-CM that deals with the relevant three-digit codes. The top 100 codes are indicated with a ""Yes"" in the Top 100 column. These codes have been identified by the authors as especially common in family medicine.""Compiled by Donald Spencer, MD, MBA, of the Department of Family Medicine, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Philip S.
